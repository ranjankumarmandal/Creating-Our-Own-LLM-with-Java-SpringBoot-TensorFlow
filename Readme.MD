# A Java Based Custom LLM Application with SpringBoot and TensorFlow

# üì¶ Java Spring Boot LLM Service with TensorFlow

This application is a lightweight, Java-only text generation service built with Spring Boot and TensorFlow Java API. It loads a pre-trained TensorFlow SavedModel and exposes a RESTful endpoint for real-time natural language generation. Designed without any Python dependencies, it ensures seamless integration into Java-based enterprise environments. The model is served entirely within the Java ecosystem, making it suitable for resource-constrained or secure environments where Python is not an option. With clean architecture, configurable properties, and extensible service logic, this app provides a scalable foundation for deploying small language models in production using modern Java frameworks.
